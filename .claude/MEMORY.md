# Agent Memory — Project State

This file is the durable memory store for AI agents. It is git-tracked and
survives container rebuilds. Update it at the end of every session.

See `docs/agent-memory.md` for technical gotchas useful to humans too.

---

## Current state

- 97/97 tests passing
- Security controls complete — see `docs/security.md`
- Operations complete: `rename` (TS+Vue), `move` (TS+Vue), `moveSymbol` (TS only), `findReferences` (TS+Vue, read-only)
- Deps pinned; pnpm override deduplicates `@volar/language-core` to 2.4.28
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm check` on push/PR to main
- Architecture slices A1, A2, A4 complete (see handoff.md for A3, A5, A6)

## Source layout

```
src/
  cli.ts          ← daemon + serve commands
  schema.ts
  workspace.ts    ← isWithinWorkspace() — shared boundary utility
  mcp.ts          ← MCP server (connects to daemon)
  daemon/
    daemon.ts     ← socket server; request-serialisation mutex; isDaemonAlive + removeDaemonFiles
    paths.ts      ← socketPath, lockfilePath, ensureCacheDir
    dispatcher.ts ← dispatchRequest; engine singletons; vue scan post-step
  engines/
    errors.ts     ← EngineError class + ErrorCode union (A1)
    types.ts
    text-utils.ts ← applyTextEdits(), offsetToLineCol() shared utilities
    ts/
      engine.ts   ← TsEngine (ts-morph)
      project.ts  ← findTsConfig, findTsConfigForFile, isVueProject
    vue/
      engine.ts   ← VueEngine (Volar)
      scan.ts     ← updateVueImportsAfterMove (regex scan for .vue SFCs)
```

## Next up

1. **A3** — unified file walker with gitignore support (`src/engines/file-walk.ts`)
2. **A5** — provider/engine separation (depends on A1, now complete)
3. **New operations** — `getDefinition` is next highest agent value; see `docs/handoff.md`

## Parallel agent lesson

Background agents launched with `isolation: "worktree"` cannot create new files
or run Bash without interactive approval. They only work reliably on tasks that
exclusively edit existing files. For slices that create new files, implement
directly in the main session. Always use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (not
`"Bash"`) when file writes are needed.

## Architecture watch: per-workspace vs per-operation engine selection

The dispatcher picks one engine per workspace. Correct for `rename`/`moveFile` (Volar needs the full project graph). Wrong for `moveSymbol` (pure AST surgery, Volar has nothing to offer). Future fix: per-operation selection or a fallback path inside `VueEngine.moveSymbol`. Tracked in `docs/handoff.md` and tech-debt.md.

## Vue awareness fix (completed this session)

`updateVueImportsAfterMove` was moved from both engine `moveFile()` implementations to the dispatcher's `move` handler as a post-step. Engines are now pure language-service wrappers. The scan runs once in the dispatcher regardless of which engine handled the move.

## MCP tool dogfooding note

`mcp__light-bridge__move` updates both project files (via `getEditsForFileRename`) and out-of-project files (via post-scan in `collectTsFiles`). Test files in `tests/` are handled automatically. `vitest.config.ts` excludes `tests/fixtures/**` so fixture files aren't picked up as test suites.

## Agent behaviour

**Commit body explains WHY, not WHAT.**
Code diffs show what changed. The body should explain decisions and tradeoffs —
not enumerate files or re-describe the diff. Split commits at logical boundaries;
don't force a split when one file spans two concerns.

**Do not use `~/.claude/` for memory.**
That path is ephemeral and wiped on container rebuild. Write here or to
`docs/agent-memory.md` instead. The memory storage rule in CLAUDE.md is
authoritative.
