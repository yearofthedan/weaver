**Purpose:** Current state, source layout, and prioritised next work items. Each task either links to a spec file (ready to implement) or is marked `[needs design]` (needs a `/spec` pass first).
**Audience:** Engineers implementing features, AI agents working on the codebase.
**Status:** Current
**Related docs:** [Why](why.md) (product rationale), [Features](features/) (features & tools), [Tech Debt](tech/tech-debt.md) (known issues), [Specs](specs/) (task specifications)

# Handoff Notes

Context that isn't in the feature docs — things you need to know before picking up the work.

## Start here

**New to the codebase?** Read in this order:
1. [`docs/why.md`](why.md) — what this is and why it exists
2. [`docs/agent-users.md`](agent-users.md) — how agents differ from human users; read before speccing any feature
3. [`docs/features/daemon.md`](features/daemon.md) — understand the daemon before touching `serve`
4. [`docs/features/mcp-transport.md`](features/mcp-transport.md) — how `serve` connects to the daemon
5. [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) — provider/operation architecture; read before touching anything in `src/`
6. [`docs/quality.md`](quality.md) — testing and reliability expectations

**Picking up a task?** Tasks have one of two states:
- **Has a spec link** → ready to implement. Read the spec, then run `/slice`.
- **`[needs design]`** → problem understood, solution not yet agreed. Run `/spec` to create a spec with the user before writing code.

An agent discovering new work should add a `[needs design]` entry and move on — do not design it in the same session.

**Finishing a task?** The spec's Done-when section is the checklist. Key items:
1. Archive the spec to `docs/specs/archive/` with an Outcome section
2. Remove or update the entry below
3. Update docs if public surfaces changed (see Done-when in the spec)
4. Write gotchas or decisions to `docs/agent-memory.md`

Directory layout matches domain boundaries:

```

## Next things to build

Priorities run top to bottom. Complete a tier before starting the next — later tiers depend on the quality signal from earlier ones.

---

### P1 — Fix now (bugs / correctness)

- **`rename` / `findReferences` / `getDefinition` fail with "Could not find source file" on `.ts` inputs** `[needs design]` — Separate from the Vue `.vue`-path bug above. Suspected cause: caller-supplied path differs from ts-morph's internally normalized path (e.g. symlinked workspace root); fix likely requires using `sourceFile.getFilePath()` when calling TS language service methods in `TsProvider`. Root cause not yet reproduced in a test.

---

### P2 — Distribution (ship what exists)

- **Pre-public release infrastructure** → [`docs/specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md`](specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md) — Release Please pipeline, CodeQL, branch protection, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, `package.json` modernisation

- **`moveFile` does not update imports in files outside `tsconfig.include`** `[needs design]` — tool description says "Works for non-source files (tests, scripts, config) too" but imports within moved test files are not rewritten when directory depth changes, and test files that import a moved source file are not updated. Two failure modes: (a) source file moved → test imports to it break; (b) test file moved to different depth → its own `src/` imports break. Both require manual fixes today. Fix likely requires a second pass using text-based rewriting (outside ts-morph) for files not in `tsconfig.include`.

- **Stage 2: Claude Code plugin** `[needs design]` — package as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); complements existing `typescript-lsp` code intelligence plugin with refactoring tools; one-command install via `/plugin install`

---

### P3 — High-value features

- **Workspace split: `app` + `tooling` (`conventions` + `evals`)** `[needs design]` — move `agent:check`, `agent:doctor`, and `eval` scripts plus related tests into a tooling project; keep app unit tests and mutation testing with app initially; define dependency ownership and migration steps that preserve CI and publish flows
- `buildVolarService` refactoring `[needs design]` — extract named sub-functions from the ~176-line monolith; prerequisite for more Vue operations
- `findReferences` by file path `[needs design]` — "who imports this file?"; see [findReferences.md](features/findReferences.md)
- **Stage 3: Claude Code Marketplace submission** `[needs design]` — submit to official Anthropic marketplace; position alongside LSP code intelligence plugins

---

### P3.5 — Quality tooling

- **Test colocation and mutation speed** → [`docs/specs/20260305-colocate-tests.md`](specs/20260305-colocate-tests.md) — Two-stage refactor: (1) move unit tests next to source, integration tests to `__tests__/`; (2) refactor source files mixing concerns (`searchText` utilities, `security` concerns, `getTypeErrors` dispatcher plumbing) and optimize fixture copying for `perTest` coverage analysis.

---

### P4 — Medium-value features and tech debt

- `getTypeErrors` Volar support for `.vue` files `[needs design]` — extend type error detection to `.vue` SFC `<script>` blocks
- `extractFunction` Vue support `[needs design]` — extend extractFunction to `.vue` SFC `<script setup>` blocks; depends on buildVolarService refactoring
- `moveSymbol` from a `.vue` source file `[needs design]` — symbol declared in `<script setup>` block; depends on buildVolarService refactoring; see [moveSymbol.md](features/moveSymbol.md)
- `createFile` `[needs design]` — scaffold a file with correct import paths
- **Agent guidance on type errors in tool responses** `[needs design]` — all write operations return `typeErrors`; agents need to know this is an action item (something wasn't fully updated) and follow up with `replaceText`. Currently nothing teaches this pattern. Decision needed: shipped skill file, tool description addition, CLAUDE.md guidance snippet, or combination?
- **`moveFile` type error return contract** `[needs design]` — currently returns `ok: true` even when `typeErrorCount > 0`. Callers must check both status and `typeErrors` separately. Consider: return `ok: false` when type errors present, add `warnings` field, or change contract to be clearer about semantic vs. structural success. Low priority, usability improvement.
- **Batch file operations** `[needs design]` — `moveFile` requires N sequential calls for N files; no atomicity. Offer `moveFiles(oldPaths[], newPath)` and `moveDirectory(oldPath, newPath)`. Low priority, quality-of-life improvement for agents.
- **`searchText` output optimization** `[needs design]` — context array adds ~70% JSON overhead (~150-200 bytes/match). Consider: (a) return `line`/`col` only; (b) only include context when explicitly requested; (c) sparse representation for non-matching lines. Low priority, large-result-set efficiency.

---

### P5 — Low priority / accepted

- **`moveSymbol` for class methods** — extract a method to a standalone exported function. Deferred: the only safe subset (static methods / no-`this` instance methods) doesn't update call sites, so it always leaves broken code. Without call-site rewriting, the value over manual `searchText` + `replaceText` is low. Revisit if call-site rewriting becomes tractable.
- **`inlineVariable` / `inlineFunction`** — less common refactoring pattern; complex to implement safely
- **Rollback / `--dry-run`** — multi-file operations have no all-or-nothing guarantee; documented precondition (clean git working tree) is workable for now
- **Watcher own-writes redundant invalidation** — safe as-is; only adds one extra rebuild per write-heavy op (see tech-debt.md)
- **Daemon discovery cache invalidation** — only hurts if `tsconfig.json` moves at runtime (see tech-debt.md)
- **`VolarLanguageService` hand-typed interface** — low urgency; will resolve naturally during further Volar refactoring (see tech-debt.md)
- **TOCTOU symlink race** — accepted risk; revisit only if deployment model changes (see tech-debt.md)

---

## Technical context

- **`docs/tech/volar-v3.md`** — how the Vue provider works around TypeScript's refusal to process `.vue` files. Read this before touching `src/providers/volar.ts`.
- **`docs/tech/tech-debt.md`** — known structural issues. Includes the `ensureDaemon` one-shot bug.
- **`@volar/language-core` version skew** — `@vue/language-core` and `@volar/typescript` previously depended on different patch versions of `@volar/language-core`, causing type mismatches. Fixed via `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` pinning to 2.4.28. `@volar/language-core` is also a direct `devDependency` so TypeScript can resolve the `Language<string>` type import in `volar.ts`.
- **`moveFile` import gap for files outside `tsconfig.include`** — test files and scripts are not in the ts-morph project; imports in/to them are not rewritten on move. See P2 backlog for details. Workaround: use `replaceText` to fix paths manually after moving.
