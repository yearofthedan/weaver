# Handoff Notes

Context that isn't in the feature docs — things you need to know before picking up the work.

## Start here

Read the docs in this order:
1. `docs/vision.md` — what this is and where it's going
2. `docs/features/daemon.md` — understand the daemon before touching `serve`
3. `docs/features/mcp-transport.md` — how `serve` connects to the daemon
4. `docs/features/engines.md` — understand the engine boundary before touching anything
5. `docs/quality.md` — testing and reliability expectations

## Current state

**117/117 tests passing.** Security controls, project restructure, all four initial operations plus `getDefinition`, and architecture slices A1/A2/A3/A4 complete. The file layout reflects domain boundaries:

```
src/
  cli.ts          ← registers only: daemon, serve
  schema.ts
  workspace.ts    ← isWithinWorkspace() — shared boundary utility
  mcp.ts          ← MCP server (connects to daemon)
  daemon/
    daemon.ts     ← socket server; promise-chain mutex; isDaemonAlive + removeDaemonFiles lifecycle fns
    paths.ts      ← socketPath, lockfilePath, ensureCacheDir only
    dispatcher.ts ← dispatchRequest; engine singletons; vue scan post-step
  engines/
    errors.ts     ← EngineError class + ErrorCode union
    types.ts
    text-utils.ts ← applyTextEdits(), offsetToLineCol() — shared by both engines
    file-walk.ts  ← walkFiles(dir, extensions) + SKIP_DIRS — git-aware, shared by both engines
    ts/
      engine.ts   ← TypeScript refactoring via ts-morph
      project.ts  ← findTsConfig, findTsConfigForFile, isVueProject
    vue/
      engine.ts   ← Vue/Volar refactoring
      scan.ts     ← updateVueImportsAfterMove (regex scan for .vue SFC imports)
```

**Known remaining gap** — `updateVueImportsAfterMove` (vue/scan) does not enforce workspace boundary on its regex scan. Low risk in practice (search root is clamped to tsconfig directory), tracked in tech-debt.md.

**Operations shipped:**
- `rename` — TS + Vue
- `move` — TS + Vue
- `moveSymbol` — TS only; Vue throws `NOT_SUPPORTED` (dispatcher constraint, not Volar)
- `findReferences` — TS + Vue; read-only, returns all references to a symbol by position
- `getDefinition` — TS + Vue; read-only, returns definition location(s) for a symbol by position

---

## Next things to build

Evaluate each candidate: does the daemon's stateful engine make it meaningfully better than the agent editing directly? `rename`, `move`, and `findReferences` benefit strongly because they require project-wide reference tracking.

- **`findReferences` by file path** — "who imports this file?" is a different question from "who uses this symbol?". Options: union references across all exports (expensive), use `getEditsForFileRename` as a dry-run proxy (already available from `moveFile`), or scan import strings with the compiler's module resolver. Worth a separate design pass — keep separate from the symbol-position variant.
- **`extractFunction`** — pull a selection into a named function, updating the call site
- **`inlineVariable` / `inlineFunction`** — collapse a trivially-used binding
- **`deleteFile`** — remove a file and clean up its imports in other files
- **`createFile`** — scaffolding with correct import paths inferred from location

## Architecture slices

Structural improvements, prioritised by impact-to-effort ratio. Each is a self-contained slice. Do them in order — later slices are cheaper once earlier ones land.

### Slice A5: Provider/engine separation

The big structural refactor. Extract a `LanguageProvider` interface with pure methods (no file I/O):

```ts
interface LanguageProvider {
  getRenameLocations(file: string, offset: number): RenameLocation[];
  getFileRenameEdits(oldPath: string, newPath: string): FileTextEdits[];
  getReferencesAtPosition(file: string, offset: number): ReferenceLocation[];
  resolveOffset(file: string, line: number, col: number): number;
}
```

`TsProvider` and `VolarProvider` implement only the compiler-specific calls. A shared engine layer (functions or a `BaseEngine`) handles: file existence checks, offset resolution, workspace boundary filtering, disk I/O, result shaping. Each new operation drops from ~80 lines per engine to ~20 lines in one place.

**Includes:** extract `VueEngine.buildService` (200 lines) into `src/engines/vue/service-builder.ts` as part of this slice.

**Files:** new `src/engines/providers/ts.ts`, `src/engines/providers/volar.ts`, `src/engines/vue/service-builder.ts`, major edits to `ts/engine.ts`, `vue/engine.ts`, `types.ts`.
**Depends on:** A1 (typed errors) for clean error paths in the shared layer.
**See also:** tech-debt.md "Missing provider/engine separation" and "Dispatcher: operation-centric architecture".

### Slice A6: Data-driven MCP registration and dispatcher

After the provider/engine split makes the shapes uniform:

- **mcp.ts:** replace 4 identical tool handlers with a tool definition table and a single registration loop. Cuts ~230 lines of copy-paste. Adding an operation becomes a one-liner table entry.
- **dispatcher.ts:** replace if-chain with an operation descriptor table. Each entry specifies which params are paths (for workspace validation), the engine method, and the response formatter.

**Files:** `src/mcp.ts`, `src/daemon/dispatcher.ts`.
**Depends on:** A5 (provider/engine separation) for uniform operation shapes.

## Technical context

- **`docs/tech/volar-v3.md`** — how the Vue engine works around TypeScript's refusal to process `.vue` files. Read this before touching `src/engines/vue-engine.ts`.
- **`docs/tech/tech-debt.md`** — known structural issues in the engine layer. Includes the `ensureDaemon` one-shot bug.
- **`@volar/language-core` version skew** — `@vue/language-core` and `@volar/typescript` previously depended on different patch versions of `@volar/language-core`, causing type mismatches. Fixed via `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` pinning to 2.4.28. `@volar/language-core` is also a direct `devDependency` so TypeScript can resolve the `Language<string>` type import in `vue-engine.ts`.

## Architecture decisions

- **Per-workspace engine selection — a known limitation** — `dispatcher.ts` picks one engine per workspace: if any `.vue` files are present, `VueEngine` handles everything, including `.ts` files. This is correct for `rename`, `moveFile`, and `findReferences` (Volar understands the full project graph). But it means `moveSymbol` in a Vue project hits `NOT_SUPPORTED` even when both files are plain `.ts`. The fix is per-operation engine selection or a fallback path inside `VueEngine.moveSymbol` that delegates to `TsEngine`. The current approach is kept because it is simpler and the broken case is uncommon; tracked in tech-debt.md.

- **`moveSymbol` for Vue sources (`.vue` → `.ts`) is buildable** — extract the declaration from a `<script setup>` block using `@vue/compiler-sfc`'s `parse()`, write to the destination `.ts`, and patch importers. Moving *into* a `.vue` destination is not worth supporting.

- **Read-only operations do not take a `workspace` parameter in the engine interface** — `findReferences` returns all references including those outside the workspace; it is up to the dispatcher to validate the input file is within the workspace. Write operations (`rename`, `moveFile`, `moveSymbol`) take `workspace` because they need to know which collateral writes to skip.

- **`VueEngine.translateLocations` is the shared virtual→real mapping helper** — extracted from the inline loop in `rename`; reused by `findReferences` and `getDefinition`. Any future operation that reads positions from a Vue project should call this method rather than duplicating the source-map traversal.

- **`VueEngine.toVirtualLocation` for operations that don't auto-translate** — `findRenameLocations` and `getReferencesAtPosition` in Volar's proxy translate real `.vue` paths → `.vue.ts` automatically. `getDefinitionAtPosition` does NOT — it calls TypeScript's internal implementation directly and throws `Could not find source file: App.vue`. Fix: call `toVirtualLocation(absPath, pos)` first to map to the virtual `.vue.ts` coordinate space, then pass those to `getDefinitionAtPosition`. Results still go through `translateLocations` for the reverse mapping. Any future operation that hits the same error pattern needs this treatment.

- **MCP transport uses `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`** — the agent-facing stdio layer uses the official SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.26.0`). The internal daemon↔serve socket uses plain newline-delimited JSON, no library needed.
- **SDK wire format is newline-delimited JSON — NOT Content-Length framed** — `StdioServerTransport` sends/reads `JSON.stringify(msg) + '\n'`. `McpTestClient` must match this format.
- **SDK is Zod v3/v4 agnostic** — pass Zod v3 schemas from `src/schema.ts` directly to `registerTool`. No version conflict.
- **Daemon socket: one connection per call** — `serve` opens a fresh Unix socket connection per tool call, writes one JSON line, reads one JSON line, closes.
- **`callDaemon` error → `DAEMON_STARTING`** — if the socket connection fails (e.g. daemon not yet ready), return `{ ok: false, error: "DAEMON_STARTING", message: "..." }` to the agent.
- **`ensureDaemon` fires once at startup** — if the daemon dies after `serve` starts, tool calls return `DAEMON_STARTING` permanently. See tech-debt.md for the fix.
- **Test helper: `McpTestClient`** — handles newline-delimited framing and the initialize handshake. `spawnAndWaitForReady` requires `{ pipeStdin: true }` for MCP tests.
- **Vertical slice tests assert before and after** — always read fixture files before the operation to confirm original state, then assert both old string is gone and new string present.
- **`filesSkipped` in engine results** — collateral writes outside the workspace are skipped and listed in `filesSkipped`. Agents should surface this to the user.
- **`ts-engine.moveFile` uses language service directly** — `ls.getEditsForFileRename()` applied file-by-file, then `fs.renameSync`. `sourceFile.move()` + `project.save()` has no per-file whitelist API. ts-morph project invalidated after the operation and rebuilt on next call.
