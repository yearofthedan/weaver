**Purpose:** Current state, source layout, and prioritised next work items. Each task either links to a spec file (ready to implement) or is marked `[needs design]` (needs a `/spec` pass first).
**Audience:** Engineers implementing features, AI agents working on the codebase.
**Status:** Current
**Related docs:** [Why](why.md) (product rationale), [Features](features/) (features & tools), [Tech Debt](tech/tech-debt.md) (known issues), [Specs](specs/) (task specifications)

# Handoff Notes

Context that isn't in the feature docs — things you need to know before picking up the work.

## Start here

**New to the codebase?** Read in this order:
1. [`docs/why.md`](why.md) — what this is and why it exists
2. [`docs/agent-users.md`](agent-users.md) — how agents differ from human users; read before speccing any feature
3. [`docs/features/daemon.md`](features/daemon.md) — understand the daemon before touching `serve`
4. [`docs/features/mcp-transport.md`](features/mcp-transport.md) — how `serve` connects to the daemon
5. [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) — compiler/operation architecture; read before touching anything in `src/`
6. [`docs/quality.md`](quality.md) — testing and reliability expectations

**Picking up a task?** Tasks have one of two states:
- **Has a spec link** → ready to implement. Read the spec, then run `/slice`.
- **`[needs design]`** → problem understood, solution not yet agreed. Run `/spec` to create a spec with the user before writing code.

An agent discovering new work should add a `[needs design]` entry and move on — do not design it in the same session.

**Finishing a task?** The spec's Done-when section is the checklist. Key items:
1. Archive the spec to `docs/specs/archive/` with an Outcome section
2. Remove or update the entry below
3. Update docs if public surfaces changed (see Done-when in the spec)
4. Write gotchas to the relevant `docs/features/` or `docs/tech/` doc; cross-cutting process rules go in `.claude/MEMORY.md`

## Next things to build

Priorities run top to bottom. Complete a tier before starting the next — later tiers depend on the quality signal from earlier ones. If a priority item needs design, don't skip it.

### P1 — Very high value bugs and tech debt

- **Test colocation Phase 1: unit tests** → [`docs/specs/20260315-colocate-unit-tests.md`](specs/20260315-colocate-unit-tests.md) — Move unit tests next to source, fixtures and shared helpers to `src/__testHelpers__/`.

  **AC2 tooling observation (for spec agent):** `moveDirectory` was used for all 9 fixture directories. Two bugs were observed:
  1. The tool does not delete the source directory tree after moving. It leaves behind empty directory shells that must be removed manually with `rm -rf`.
  2. The tool corrupted internal imports in fixture files. Each fixture is a self-contained project with its own `tsconfig.json`. The imports within them are relative sibling paths (e.g. `"./utils"`, `"./composables/useCounter"`). After `moveDirectory`, those imports were rewritten to long cross-tree relative paths pointing back to the old location (e.g. `"../../../../tests/fixtures/simple-ts/src/utils"`). The tool did not recognise the fixture's own tsconfig boundary and treated the internal imports as references to be rewritten relative to the new location in the main project tree. All 9 corrupted files had to be manually restored from git. The affected files were: `simple-ts/src/main.ts`, `multi-importer/src/featureA.ts`, `multi-importer/src/featureB.ts`, `move-dir-ts/src/app.ts`, `delete-file-ts/src/barrel.ts`, `delete-file-ts/src/importer.ts`, `cross-boundary/consumer/main.ts`, `vue-project/src/App.vue`, `vue-ts-boundary/src/App.vue`.

  **AC2 structure note (for spec agent):** After fixtures land in `src/__testHelpers__/`, the directory will contain 9 project scaffold directories plus `helpers.ts` (from AC3) at the same level. A `fixtures/` subdirectory (i.e. `src/__testHelpers__/fixtures/`) would improve clarity — readers would immediately distinguish project scaffolds from the helper module. However, the spec as written does not include this subdirectory, so it was not added. If the spec agent agrees, update AC2/AC3 to use `src/__testHelpers__/fixtures/` before those ACs ship, and update `tests/helpers.ts` accordingly.

- **Test colocation Phase 2: integration tests** → [`docs/specs/20260315-colocate-integration-tests.md`](specs/20260315-colocate-integration-tests.md) — Move integration tests to colocated `*.integration.test.ts` files, remove `tests/` directory. Blocked by Phase 1.

- **Source refactoring for mutation speed** → [`docs/specs/20260315-source-refactor-mutation-speed.md`](specs/20260315-source-refactor-mutation-speed.md) — Extract misplaced utilities from operations (`searchText`, `security`, `getTypeErrors`), optimize fixture copying for `perTest` coverage analysis, exclude redundant dispatcher tests from Stryker. Depends on test colocation landing first.

- **`getTypeErrors` / write operations: add `warn` status level** `[needs design]` — Currently status is binary (`ok: true/false`). Type errors after a write operation (e.g. `moveFile` returns `ok: true` with `typeErrorCount > 0`) should surface as `status: "warn"` so agents know the operation succeeded structurally but left unresolved references. Supersedes the P4 "moveFile type error return contract" entry. Note: `warn` alone won't catch all failures — `moveFile` can return `ok: true, typeErrorCount: 0` despite broken imports, because `getTypeErrorsForFiles` always uses TsMorphCompiler regardless of which compiler performed the operation. If VolarCompiler performed the move and left broken specifiers, TsMorphCompiler's post-write type check may not detect the resolution failures depending on module resolution settings. Reliable detection may need the post-write type check to run through the same compiler that performed the operation.

---

### P2 — High-value features / bugs / tech debt

- **CLI-first transport: expose operations as CLI subcommands** `[needs design]` — Currently operations are only reachable via MCP. Add CLI subcommands (e.g. `light-bridge rename --symbol Foo --to Bar`) that talk to the existing daemon. Benefits: zero context-token cost (MCP schemas consume input tokens every turn), no `.mcp.json` setup friction, works with any agent that can shell out, enables Unix piping and composition, enables interactive selection workflows (e.g. `replaceText --interactive` presenting matches one-by-one like `git add -p`), and `--dry-run` previews. MCP remains as an optional transport. The daemon architecture already supports this — the new layer is thin (arg parsing → daemon request → JSON output).

- **Pre-public release infrastructure** → [`docs/specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md`](specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md) — Release Please pipeline, CodeQL, branch protection, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, `package.json` modernisation
- `buildVolarService` refactoring `[needs design]` — extract named sub-functions from the ~176-line monolith; prerequisite for more Vue operations
- `findReferences` by file path `[needs design]` — "who imports this file?"; see [findReferences.md](features/findReferences.md)
- **Extract `src/adapters/` for CLI and MCP entry points** `[needs design]` — `mcp.ts` and `cli.ts` are inbound adapters translating external protocols (MCP JSON-RPC, CLI args) into internal operation calls. Move them into `src/adapters/mcp/` and `src/adapters/cli/` to make the ports-and-adapters boundary explicit. Mirrors the existing `src/ports/` (outbound abstractions) with inbound counterparts.
- **Daemon request logging** `[needs design]` — The daemon has no logging after the startup ready signal. Stderr is disconnected from the parent after spawn. Debugging daemon-only bugs requires patching source, rebuilding, and manually wiring stderr to a file. Add structured per-request logging (method, compiler used, edits count, duration) to a log file. Discovered during the VolarCompiler moveFile investigation — the key insight (wrong compiler was handling the request) was invisible without instrumentation.
---

### P3 — Medium-value features / bugs / tech debt

- `getTypeErrors` Volar support for `.vue` files `[needs design]` — extend type error detection to `.vue` SFC `<script>` blocks
- `extractFunction` Vue support `[needs design]` — extend extractFunction to `.vue` SFC `<script setup>` blocks; depends on buildVolarService refactoring
- `moveSymbol` from a `.vue` source file `[needs design]` — symbol declared in `<script setup>` block; depends on buildVolarService refactoring; see [moveSymbol.md](features/moveSymbol.md)
- **`searchText` output optimization** `[needs design]` — context array adds ~70% JSON overhead (~150-200 bytes/match). Consider: (a) return `line`/`col` only; (b) only include context when explicitly requested; (c) sparse representation for non-matching lines. Low priority, large-result-set efficiency.
- **: Claude Code plugin** `[needs design]` — package as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); complements existing `typescript-lsp` code intelligence plugin with refactoring tools; one-command install via `/plugin install`
- **Workspace split: `app` + `tooling` (`conventions` + `evals`)** `[needs design]` — move `agent:check`, `agent:doctor`, and `eval` scripts plus related tests into a tooling project; keep app unit tests and mutation testing with app initially; define dependency ownership and migration steps that preserve CI and publish flows
- **: Claude Code Marketplace submission** `[needs design]` — submit to official Anthropic marketplace; position alongside LSP code intelligence plugins
- **`moveSymbol` cannot move non-exported local functions** `[needs design]` — `moveSymbol` only handles top-level exported declarations. Attempting to move an unexported helper returns `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND`. Workaround: manually create the destination file with the symbol exported, remove from source, add import. See handoff.md "Agent reflection" section for context.
- `createFile` `[needs design]` — scaffold a file with correct import paths
- **Agent guidance on type errors in tool responses** `[needs design]` — all write operations return `typeErrors`; agents need to know this is an action item (something wasn't fully updated) and follow up with `replaceText`. Currently nothing teaches this pattern. Decision needed: shipped skill file, tool description addition, CLAUDE.md guidance snippet, or combination?
- **`rename` doesn't catch derived variable names** `[needs design]` — `rename` follows the compiler's reference graph, which is correct for type-checked references. But when renaming `TsProvider` → `TsMorphCompiler`, variables like `tsProviderSingleton`, `pluginProviders`, `stubProvider` are untouched — they're just strings to the compiler. During the providers→compilers rename this meant ~100 extra tool calls for what should have been automatic. Possible approaches: (a) `rename --derived` flag that does a substring text pass after the compiler rename; (b) smarter `findReferences` that can return construct types (variable, type, import, parameter) like IntelliJ's "Find Usages" — let the caller filter by kind and batch-rename; (c) `rename` automatically identifies variables whose names derive from the renamed symbol (e.g. local variables typed as the renamed interface, or variables assigned from an import of the renamed symbol) and offers to rename them too. The IntelliJ model is worth studying — it distinguishes types, variables, imports, and string occurrences in its rename dialog.
- **`TsMorphCompiler.afterSymbolMove` fallback scan tests are in the wrong layer** `[needs design]` — Tests live in `tests/operations/moveSymbol-fallback.test.ts` but should be in `tests/compilers/ts-after-symbol-move.test.ts` calling `afterSymbolMove` directly. The "no-op" test formerly in `ts.test.ts` was a smoke test, not real coverage. The integration path (`moveSymbol` operation -> `tsMoveSymbol` -> `afterSymbolMove`) also needs a proper integration test in `moveSymbol_tsCompiler.test.ts`.
- **Agents don't reach for the tools even when loaded** `[needs design]` — The `light-bridge-refactoring` skill is loaded on the execution agent and explicitly tells it to use `moveSymbol`, `rename`, `findReferences` etc. for cross-file changes. It still reaches for manual Edit + Grep instead. Observed during the `extensions.ts` extraction: agent manually moved constants and fixed imports by hand instead of calling `moveSymbol`. The skill file, tool descriptions, and MCP server instructions are all present — the agent ignores them. This is the existential problem for the project: if the tool's own development agent won't use the tools, external consumers won't either. Needs investigation into why agents bypass MCP tools in favour of built-in editing, and what (if anything) can make them prefer compiler-aware tools. Possible angles: tool description phrasing, latency/cost perception, response format, or fundamental model behaviour that can't be influenced by descriptions alone.

---

### P4 — Low priority

- **`moveSymbol` for class methods** — extract a method to a standalone exported function. Deferred: the only safe subset (static methods / no-`this` instance methods) doesn't update call sites, so it always leaves broken code. Without call-site rewriting, the value over manual `searchText` + `replaceText` is low. Revisit if call-site rewriting becomes tractable.
- **`inlineVariable` / `inlineFunction`** — less common refactoring pattern; complex to implement safely
- **Rollback / `--dry-run`** — multi-file operations have no all-or-nothing guarantee; documented precondition (clean git working tree) is workable for now
- **Watcher own-writes redundant invalidation** — safe as-is; only adds one extra rebuild per write-heavy op (see tech-debt.md)
- **Daemon discovery cache invalidation** — only hurts if `tsconfig.json` moves at runtime (see tech-debt.md)
- **`VolarLanguageService` hand-typed interface** — low urgency; will resolve naturally during further Volar refactoring (see tech-debt.md)
- **TOCTOU symlink race** — accepted risk; revisit only if deployment model changes (see tech-debt.md)

## Agent process notes

**`pnpm check` was run twice with no changes in between (2026-03-15):** After fixing a Biome import-ordering error with `biome check --write`, `pnpm check 2>&1 | tee /tmp/check3.log | tail -20` was submitted as a background task. Because it was backgrounded, the terminal returned immediately with no output — the command hadn't produced anything yet. Seeing empty output, the instinct was to run it again. That is wrong. The correct responses are: (1) wait to be notified the background task completed, then `Read /tmp/check3.log`; or (2) don't background `pnpm check` at all — run it synchronously and wait. Never re-run a long command because its backgrounded output looked empty.

---

## Technical context

- **`docs/tech/volar-v3.md`** — how the Vue compiler works around TypeScript's refusal to process `.vue` files. Read this before touching `src/plugins/vue/compiler.ts`.
- **`docs/tech/tech-debt.md`** — known structural issues. Includes the `ensureDaemon` one-shot bug.
- **`@volar/language-core` version skew** — `@vue/language-core` and `@volar/typescript` previously depended on different patch versions of `@volar/language-core`, causing type mismatches. Fixed via `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` pinning to 2.4.28. `@volar/language-core` is also a direct `devDependency` so TypeScript can resolve the `Language<string>` type import in `volar.ts`.

---

## Agent reflection: `moveSymbol` limitation — only exported declarations

During the `moveFile` workspace-scope spec, the spec directed the agent to try `mcp__light-bridge__moveSymbol` to move `makeMockCompiler` from `tests/operations/rename.test.ts` to `tests/compilers/__helpers__/mock-compiler.ts`. The call returned `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND` because `makeMockCompiler` is a local (non-exported) function.

`moveSymbol` only handles **top-level exported declarations** (`export function`, `export const`, `export class`, etc.). It cannot move unexported helpers. When a symbol needs to be extracted and made public for the first time, the workflow is:

1. Try `moveSymbol` — if it returns `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND`, the symbol is not exported.
2. Fall back to: create the destination file manually with the symbol exported, then remove it from the source and add the import.

There is no light-bridge tool for "add export keyword + move". This is a known gap — if it becomes a recurring friction point, add a `[needs design]` entry.
