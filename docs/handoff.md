**Purpose:** Current state, source layout, and prioritised next work items. Each task either links to a spec file (ready to implement) or is marked `[needs design]` (needs a `/spec` pass first).
**Audience:** Engineers implementing features, AI agents working on the codebase.
**Status:** Current
**Related docs:** [Why](why.md) (product rationale), [Features](features/) (features & tools), [Tech Debt](tech/tech-debt.md) (known issues), [Specs](specs/) (task specifications)

# Handoff Notes

Context that isn't in the feature docs — things you need to know before picking up the work.

## Start here

**New to the codebase?** Read in this order:
1. [`docs/why.md`](why.md) — what this is and why it exists
2. [`docs/agent-users.md`](agent-users.md) — how agents differ from human users; read before speccing any feature
3. [`docs/features/daemon.md`](features/daemon.md) — understand the daemon before touching `serve`
4. [`docs/features/mcp-transport.md`](features/mcp-transport.md) — how `serve` connects to the daemon
5. [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) — compiler/operation architecture; read before touching anything in `src/`
6. [`docs/quality.md`](quality.md) — testing and reliability expectations

**Picking up a task?** Tasks have one of two states:
- **Has a spec link** → ready to implement. Read the spec, then run `/slice`.
- **`[needs design]`** → problem understood, solution not yet agreed. Run `/spec` to create a spec with the user before writing code.

An agent discovering new work should add a `[needs design]` entry and move on — do not design it in the same session.

**Finishing a task?** The spec's Done-when section is the checklist. Key items:
1. Archive the spec to `docs/specs/archive/` with an Outcome section
2. Remove or update the entry below
3. Update docs if public surfaces changed (see Done-when in the spec)
4. Write gotchas to the relevant `docs/features/` or `docs/tech/` doc; cross-cutting process rules go in `.claude/MEMORY.md`

## Next things to build

Priorities run top to bottom. Complete a tier before starting the next. 
**IMPORTANT**: Priority is the only thing that matters. Skipping an item without a design is a failure. If a priority item needs design, spec it. 

---

### P1 — Very high value bugs and tech debt
- **Expand project graph to full workspace scope** → [`docs/specs/20260322-expand-project-graph-to-workspace.md`](specs/20260322-expand-project-graph-to-workspace.md) — Both engines use `tsconfig.include` as file scope; test files and other excluded files are invisible. Fix: load all workspace source files at bootstrap.

- **`searchText` compact output** → [`docs/specs/20260322-searchtext-compact-output.md`](specs/20260322-searchtext-compact-output.md) — Replace verbose `context` array with optional `surroundingText` string; omit context field entirely when not requested.

- **`getTypeErrors` / write operations: add `warn` status level** `[needs design]` — Currently status is binary (`ok: true/false`). Type errors after a write operation (e.g. `moveFile` returns `ok: true` with `typeErrorCount > 0`) should surface as `status: "warn"` so agents know the operation succeeded structurally but left unresolved references. Supersedes the P4 "moveFile type error return contract" entry. Note: `warn` alone won't catch all failures — `moveFile` can return `ok: true, typeErrorCount: 0` despite broken imports, because `getTypeErrorsForFiles` always uses TsMorphCompiler regardless of which compiler performed the operation. If VolarCompiler performed the move and left broken specifiers, TsMorphCompiler's post-write type check may not detect the resolution failures depending on module resolution settings. Reliable detection may need the post-write type check to run through the same compiler that performed the operation.

---

### P2 — High-value features / bugs / tech debt

- **CLI-first transport: expose operations as CLI subcommands** `[needs design]` — Currently operations are only reachable via MCP. Add CLI subcommands (e.g. `light-bridge rename --symbol Foo --to Bar`) that talk to the existing daemon. Benefits: zero context-token cost (MCP schemas consume input tokens every turn), no `.mcp.json` setup friction, works with any agent that can shell out, enables Unix piping and composition, enables interactive selection workflows (e.g. `replaceText --interactive` presenting matches one-by-one like `git add -p`), and `--dry-run` previews. MCP remains as an optional transport. The daemon architecture already supports this — the new layer is thin (arg parsing → daemon request → JSON output).
- **Pre-public release infrastructure** → [`docs/specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md`](specs/20260304-pre-public-infra.md) — Release Please pipeline, CodeQL, branch protection, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, `package.json` modernisation
- `findReferences` by file path `[needs design]` — "who imports this file?"; see [findReferences.md](features/findReferences.md)
- **`moveDirectory` VolarEngine: Vue import specifiers not rewritten** `[needs design]` — `VolarEngine.moveDirectory()` delegates to `TsMorphEngine`, which doesn't track `.vue` files. Result: `.vue` files are physically moved (as non-source files), but TS files importing `.vue` components (e.g. `import Button from "./components/Button.vue"`) are NOT rewritten to the new path. Fix: implement the virtual `.vue.ts` stub approach — create a temporary ts-morph project with `.vue.ts` stubs, call `directory.move()`, transplant rewritten imports back into SFCs.

---

### P3 — Medium-value features / bugs / tech debt

- **Remove per-operation fallback workspace walks** `[needs design]` — `moveSymbol` (engine.ts:210-211), `removeImportersOf`, and `afterFileRename` each walk the workspace independently to catch files outside tsconfig.include. Once the project graph expansion (P1 spec) ships, these fallback walks are redundant. Audit each, confirm they're dead code, and remove.

- **`utils/` vs `domain/` boundary audit** `[needs design]` — `walkWorkspaceFiles`, `file-walk.ts` (with `SKIP_DIRS`), `sensitive-files.ts` and `ts-project.ts` are workspace-aware concepts currently in `utils/`. They may belong in `domain/` alongside `workspace-scope.ts`. Similarly, `security.ts` has `isWithinWorkspace` which could be of questionable placement. And some utils have heavy fs usage. Could this live with `ports/filesystem.ts`? Audit the boundary and decide what's a generic utility vs a domain concept.

- `getTypeErrors` Volar support for `.vue` files `[needs design]` — extend type error detection to `.vue` SFC `<script>` blocks
- `extractFunction` Vue support `[needs design]` — extend extractFunction to `.vue` SFC `<script setup>` blocks
- `moveSymbol` from a `.vue` source file `[needs design]` — symbol declared in `<script setup>` block; see [moveSymbol.md](features/moveSymbol.md)
- **`moveSymbol` cannot move non-exported local functions** `[needs design]` — `moveSymbol` only handles top-level exported declarations. Attempting to move an unexported helper returns `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND`. Workaround: manually create the destination file with the symbol exported, remove from source, add import.
- **`moveSymbol` requires destination file to exist** `[needs design]` — if the destination file does not exist, `moveSymbol` fails. Callers must pre-create the file (e.g. with `export {};`) before moving symbols into it. A `createFile` capability or auto-creation in `moveSymbol` would eliminate this friction. Discovered during the `types.ts` decomposition.
- **`moveSymbol` does not carry transitive imports** `[needs design]` — when a symbol references types from other modules, those imports are not added to the destination file automatically. After moving e.g. `Compiler` (which references `WorkspaceScope`), the destination file must have the missing import added manually. Discovered during the `types.ts` decomposition.
- **`rename` doesn't catch derived variable names** `[needs design]` — `rename` follows the compiler's reference graph, which is correct for type-checked references. But when renaming `TsProvider` → `TsMorphCompiler`, variables like `tsProviderSingleton`, `pluginProviders`, `stubProvider` are untouched — they're just strings to the compiler. During the providers→compilers rename this meant ~100 extra tool calls for what should have been automatic. Possible approaches: (a) `rename --derived` flag that does a substring text pass after the compiler rename; (b) smarter `findReferences` that can return construct types (variable, type, import, parameter) like IntelliJ's "Find Usages" — let the caller filter by kind and batch-rename; (c) `rename` automatically identifies variables whose names derive from the renamed symbol and offers to rename them too.
- **Agent guidance on type errors in tool responses** `[needs design]` — all write operations return `typeErrors`; agents need to know this is an action item (something wasn't fully updated) and follow up with `replaceText`. Currently nothing teaches this pattern. Decision needed: shipped skill file, tool description addition, CLAUDE.md guidance snippet, or combination?
- **Agents don't reach for the tools even when loaded** `[needs design]` — The `light-bridge-refactoring` skill is loaded on the execution agent and explicitly tells it to use `moveSymbol`, `rename`, `findReferences` etc. for cross-file changes. It still reaches for manual Edit + Grep instead. Observed during the `extensions.ts` extraction: agent manually moved constants and fixed imports by hand instead of calling `moveSymbol`. The skill file, tool descriptions, and MCP server instructions are all present — the agent ignores them. This is the existential problem for the project: if the tool's own development agent won't use the tools, external consumers won't either. Needs investigation into why agents bypass MCP tools in favour of built-in editing, and what (if anything) can make them prefer compiler-aware tools. Possible angles: tool description phrasing, latency/cost perception, response format, or fundamental model behaviour that can't be influenced by descriptions alone.
- **`moveBlock`: move a contiguous code block between files** `[needs design]` — Move a block of code (e.g. a `describe(...)` block in a test file) from one file to another by line range: `moveBlock(sourceFile, startLine, endLine, destFile, insertAfterLine?)`. The block is self-contained — no callers to update, no reference graph involved. Main challenges: (1) import carrying — identify which imports the moved block uses, add missing ones to the destination; (2) import cleanup — remove now-unused imports from the source (ts-morph `organizeImports`); (3) insertion point — default is append to end of file. Primary use case: reorganising large test files by moving `describe` blocks without manual cut/paste + import fixup.
- `createFile` `[needs design]` — scaffold a file with correct import paths
- **: Claude Code plugin** `[needs design]` — package as a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`); complements existing `typescript-lsp` code intelligence plugin with refactoring tools; one-command install via `/plugin install`
- **: Claude Code Marketplace submission** `[needs design]` — submit to official Anthropic marketplace; position alongside LSP code intelligence plugins
- **Workspace split: `app` + `tooling` (`conventions` + `evals`)** `[needs design]` — move `agent:check`, `agent:doctor`, and `eval` scripts plus related tests into a tooling project; keep app unit tests and mutation testing with app initially; define dependency ownership and migration steps that preserve CI and publish flows

---

### P4 — Low priority

- **`moveSymbol` for class methods** — extract a method to a standalone exported function. Deferred: the only safe subset (static methods / no-`this` instance methods) doesn't update call sites, so it always leaves broken code. Without call-site rewriting, the value over manual `searchText` + `replaceText` is low. Revisit if call-site rewriting becomes tractable.
- **`inlineVariable` / `inlineFunction`** — less common refactoring pattern; complex to implement safely
- **Rollback / `--dry-run`** — multi-file operations have no all-or-nothing guarantee; documented precondition (clean git working tree) is workable for now
- **Watcher own-writes redundant invalidation** — safe as-is; only adds one extra rebuild per write-heavy op (see tech-debt.md)
- **Daemon discovery cache invalidation** — only hurts if `tsconfig.json` moves at runtime (see tech-debt.md)
- **`VolarLanguageService` hand-typed interface** — low urgency; will resolve naturally during further Volar refactoring (see tech-debt.md)
- **TOCTOU symlink race** — accepted risk; revisit only if deployment model changes (see tech-debt.md)
- **Action hook registry for plugin composition** `[needs design]` — Currently VolarCompiler implements every Engine action method by manually composing "call TS action, then do Vue cleanup." A registry pattern where plugins register pre/post hooks per action (e.g. Vue plugin registers a post-moveFile hook that scans `.vue` imports) would make composition declarative. Not needed with one plugin, but the manual approach won't scale to two. Revisit when a second plugin (Svelte, Angular) is on the horizon.

---

## Technical context

- **`docs/tech/volar-v3.md`** — how the Vue compiler works around TypeScript's refusal to process `.vue` files. Read this before touching `src/plugins/vue/engine.ts`.
- **`docs/tech/tech-debt.md`** — known structural issues. Includes the `ensureDaemon` one-shot bug.
- **`@volar/language-core` version skew** — `@vue/language-core` and `@volar/typescript` previously depended on different patch versions of `@volar/language-core`, causing type mismatches. Fixed via `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` pinning to 2.4.28. `@volar/language-core` is also a direct `devDependency` so TypeScript can resolve the `Language<string>` type import in `src/plugins/vue/engine.ts`.
