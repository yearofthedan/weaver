# rename: surface identifiers whose names contain the old symbol

## Context

`rename` follows the compiler's reference graph. That is the correct definition of "reference" but misses identifiers whose *name* contains the renamed symbol without binding to it — e.g. `tsProviderSingleton` when renaming `TsProvider`. The compiler treats those as independent symbols. During the providers→compilers rename, fixing these name-echoes one at a time cost roughly 100 extra tool calls. A single `replace-text` pass would have handled them, but the agent didn't branch to it. The signal that derived names exist is not surfaced by any tool; the agent has to already know to look for them.

## User intent

*As an agent renaming a top-level TypeScript symbol, I want to see which identifiers in the modified files still spell the old name after `rename` completes, so that I can decide whether any of them are conventions that should also be updated without hunting for them myself.*

## Relevant files

- `src/operations/types.ts` — `RenameResult` shape; gains an optional `nameMatches` field
- `src/ts-engine/rename.ts` — `tsRename`; calls the new scan after `applyTextEdits`, before returning
- `src/adapters/mcp/tools.ts` — tool description gains a line about `nameMatches` and when it fires
- `docs/features/rename.md` — Constraints / Response sections updated
- `.claude/skills/move-and-rename/SKILL.md` — the "do one `replace-text` pass for derived names" line becomes "review `nameMatches` in the response"

**New file:** `src/ts-engine/name-matches.ts` — pure function `scanNameMatches(project, oldName, filesModified, excludePositions)` returning `{ count, files, samples }`.

### Red flags

- No large test files in the rename family; `src/ts-engine/rename.ts` is 72 lines and `tsRename.test.ts` is 222. Room to grow.
- `RenameResult` is already re-exported from `src/operations/types.ts` and consumed by both MCP and CLI adapters. Adding an optional field is safe; no consumer will break.
- `VolarEngine.rename` (src/plugins/vue/engine.ts) does not invoke the scan in v1. No signature changes needed there.

**Layer-fit note:**
- AC1 (core scan behaviour) → `scanNameMatches` is a pure function of `(project, oldName, filesModified, excludePositions)`. Unit-test it directly with in-memory ts-morph projects. One integration smoke in `rename.test.ts` for the full round-trip.

## Value / Effort

- **Value:** During a broad rename, the agent sees exactly one extra field in the response showing the identifiers it didn't touch. For a narrow rename (local variable, parameter), the field is `count: 0` and ignored. This removes the single documented cause of a 100-call rename: the agent missing that derived names exist. The fix lands in the tool, not in skill prose that agents skim inconsistently.
- **Effort:** One new module (~60 lines), response shape gains one optional object. No changes to compiler behaviour, no new error codes, no breaking changes.

## Behaviour

- [ ] **AC1 — `rename` returns `nameMatches` scoped to modified files, excluding compiler-rewritten locations.** Given a TypeScript project where the symbol at the target position is named `TsProvider`, after renaming to `TsMorphCompiler`: the response contains `nameMatches: { count, files, samples }` where `samples` lists identifiers in the *already-modified files* (`filesModified`) whose text contains the string `TsProvider` as a substring, minus the locations the compiler already rewrote. Each sample is `{ file, line, col, name, kind }`. `count` is the total found; `files` is the distinct count of files containing a match; `samples` is capped at 10. String literals and comments do not appear — the scan walks AST Identifier nodes only. For Vue renames (`VolarEngine`), `nameMatches` is absent.

## Interface

### Input

```ts
RenameArgs {
  file: string;           // unchanged
  line: number;           // unchanged
  col: number;            // unchanged
  newName: string;        // unchanged
  checkTypeErrors?: boolean;  // unchanged
}
```

No new input fields. The scan always runs on TS renames.

### Output

```ts
RenameResult {
  filesModified: string[];    // unchanged
  filesSkipped: string[];     // unchanged
  symbolName: string;         // unchanged
  newName: string;            // unchanged
  locationCount: number;      // unchanged — compiler-tracked rewrites
  nameMatches?: NameMatches;  // NEW — present on TS renames; absent on Vue renames
}

interface NameMatches {
  count: number;              // total identifier matches found
  files: number;              // distinct file count, always ≤ count
  samples: NameMatchSample[]; // capped at 10, file-then-position order
}

interface NameMatchSample {
  file: string;           // absolute path
  line: number;           // 1-based
  col: number;            // 1-based
  name: string;           // the identifier text, e.g. "tsProviderSingleton"
  kind: string;           // ts-morph SyntaxKind name, e.g. "VariableDeclaration"
}
```

- **`count`:** total identifier-level matches found across modified files. Typical values 0–20.
- **`files`:** distinct count of modified files containing at least one match. Always ≤ `count`.
- **`samples`:** bounded at 10. Agents treat this as a review prompt, not an exhaustive list; they can call `search-text` for the full project scan if needed.
- **`kind`:** the ts-morph `SyntaxKind` name of the containing declaration/reference — e.g. `VariableDeclaration`, `Parameter`, `PropertyDeclaration`, `FunctionDeclaration`, `TypeAliasDeclaration`, `InterfaceDeclaration`, `ClassDeclaration`, `Identifier` (for call-site uses). Lets agents filter without parsing.

**Zero/empty case:** `{ count: 0, files: 0, samples: [] }` — scan ran, found nothing.

**Noise:** Scoping to `filesModified` eliminates the noise problem for generic names. If you rename `Type`, only files that reference your `Type` are scanned — not the whole project. Identifiers in those files named after `Type` are overwhelmingly derived from it, not coincidental.

## Open decisions

All resolved up-front. Recorded here so the executor has the reasoning.

### Decision 1: scan strategy — scope to filesModified, pure AST walk

**Resolution:** Walk AST Identifier nodes only in the files the compiler already modified (`filesModified`). This is O(modified files), not O(project), and requires no ripgrep phase. The files are already open in the ts-morph project from the rename operation, so no extra I/O. Scoping to `filesModified` handles noise naturally: a generic name like `Type` only appears in files that use your `Type`; unrelated identifiers containing "type" (TypeScript, prototype) live in files the compiler didn't touch.

### Decision 2: what "exclude compiler-rewritten locations" means

**Resolution: exclude by exact position.** Track `{ file, offset }` for each location the compiler rewrote; drop any scan hit whose `{ file, offset }` matches. Excluding by name identity is wrong — a non-renamed-symbol local variable that shadows the outer symbol could legitimately also be named `oldName` and should appear in `nameMatches` so the agent knows about it.

### Decision 3: Vue rename coverage

**Resolution: v1 covers .ts/.tsx only.** For `VolarEngine` renames, do not call the scan; leave `nameMatches` absent. Documented in `rename.md` Constraints; handoff gets a `[needs design]` entry for Vue coverage as part of this work.

### Decision 4: auto-apply vs surface-only

**Resolution: surface-only.** The transformation from old to new derived name is not deterministic (e.g. renaming `TsProvider` → `TsMorphCompiler` — does `tsProviderSingleton` become `tsMorphCompilerSingleton`? does `DEFAULT_TS_PROVIDER` become `DEFAULT_TS_MORPH_COMPILER`?). The agent has semantic context the tool doesn't. Silent wrong renames are worse than a second call. One `replaceText` handles all derived names once the agent reviews `nameMatches`.

## Security

- **Workspace boundary:** the scan reads files in `filesModified`, all of which are already within the workspace (the rename validated this). No new boundary-sensitive code paths.
- **Input injection:** `oldName` is derived from the compiler (`firstContent.slice(...)`), not user input. The regex constructed is a simple `includes(oldName)` check at the AST text level — no regex interpolation needed.
- **Response leakage:** `samples` includes identifier names and file paths — same surface as `findReferences` already exposes. No new leakage vector.

## Edges

- **Vue rename:** `VolarEngine.rename` does not invoke the scan in v1. Agents renaming inside a `.vue` file see no `nameMatches` field. Documented in `rename.md` Constraints; handoff gets a `[needs design]` entry for Vue name-match scanning.
- **Sample ordering:** samples are returned in file-then-position order (stable).
- **Case sensitivity:** the scan is case-sensitive. Renaming `TsProvider` finds `tsProviderSingleton` (substring match despite first-char case) but does not find `TSPROVIDER_CONST`. Case transforms are the agent's responsibility.
- **Rename that produces type errors:** unchanged. Type error reporting happens in the dispatcher's post-write pass; `nameMatches` is independent.
- **`locationCount` semantics:** unchanged — it remains the count of compiler-tracked rewrites. `nameMatches.count` is distinct and additive.
