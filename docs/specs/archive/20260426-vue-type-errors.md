# getTypeErrors Vue SFC support

**type:** change
**date:** 2026-04-26
**tracks:** handoff.md # getTypeErrors Volar support → docs/features/getTypeErrors.md

---

## Context

`getTypeErrors` currently only checks `.ts`/`.tsx` files via `TsMorphEngine`. The dispatcher always calls `registry.tsEngine()`, bypassing the Vue plugin entirely. Agents working in Vue projects cannot verify whether their refactoring changes broke `.vue` SFC type correctness.

## User intent

*As an agent working in a Vue project, I want `getTypeErrors` to report type errors in `.vue` files, so that I can verify refactoring changes didn't break Vue component types.*

## Relevant files

- `src/operations/getTypeErrors.ts` — current operation; takes `TsMorphEngine`, needs to change to `Engine`
- `src/operations/getTypeErrors.test.ts` — 227 lines; Vue tests belong here (same operation, same layer) — will grow to ~310 lines, past "review at 300"; assess existing tests for the refactoring hierarchy before adding new ones
- `src/ts-engine/types.ts` — `Engine` interface; add `getTypeErrors` method; `GetTypeErrorsResult` already defined
- `src/ts-engine/engine.ts` — `TsMorphEngine`; implement `getTypeErrors` wrapping existing logic
- `src/plugins/vue/engine.ts` — `VolarEngine` at 391 lines; add `getTypeErrors`; extract to standalone file if it pushes past 450
- `src/plugins/vue/service.ts` — `CachedService.baseService` (raw `ts.LanguageService`) used for `getSemanticDiagnostics`; `vueVirtualToReal` used for file enumeration in project-wide mode
- `src/daemon/dispatcher.ts` — change `getTypeErrors` entry to use `registry.projectEngine()` instead of `registry.tsEngine()`
- `src/daemon/post-write-diagnostics.ts` — out of scope; `.vue` post-write diagnostics are a separate enhancement
- `src/utils/text-utils.ts` — `offsetToLineCol` used to convert real `.vue` byte offset to 1-based line/col
- `docs/features/getTypeErrors.md` — update Constraints section and How it works diagram
- `src/__testHelpers__/fixtures/fixtures.ts` — may need a new Vue-errors fixture

### Red flags

- **`engine.test.ts` at 478 lines** — at the 500-line hard flag. Vue `getTypeErrors` tests belong at the operation layer (`getTypeErrors.test.ts`), not here. Do not add tests to `engine.test.ts` for this feature.
- **`VolarEngine` at 391 lines** — already past "review at 300". If the `getTypeErrors` implementation adds more than ~50 lines, extract to `src/plugins/vue/get-type-errors.ts` (following the `ts-engine/` standalone action pattern) and call it from `VolarEngine`.

**Layer-fit:**
- AC1–AC4: All require a real Volar service → integration layer. Tests go in `src/operations/getTypeErrors.test.ts` alongside the existing TS tests (same operation, same layer).
- Position translation logic (virtual offset → real `.vue` line/col) is a pure function of its inputs — if extracted to a standalone helper, add a focused unit test for it directly rather than covering it only through the integration path.

## Value / Effort

- **Value:** Agents in Vue projects can verify type correctness after refactoring. Without this, `getTypeErrors` silently skips all `.vue` files — a false "no errors" response that misleads agents into committing broken code.
- **Effort:** Medium. Four files to modify (operation, Engine interface, TsMorphEngine, VolarEngine) plus dispatcher. The Volar machinery (source maps, virtual path mapping) already exists in `VolarEngine`; this reuses it. A new test fixture is needed. Estimated 5–8 touched files including tests.

## Behaviour

- [ ] **AC1** — Single-file, Vue with SFC errors: Given `file` pointing to a `.vue` file whose SFC contains a type error (anywhere: script block, template binding, prop mismatch), `getTypeErrors` returns a diagnostic with `file` set to the real `.vue` path (not the virtual `.vue.ts`), `line` and `col` as 1-based positions in the actual `.vue` source, the correct TS error code, and the top-level message. Virtual-position-only diagnostics (Volar glue code with no source mapping) are excluded.
  - *Layer: integration. Laziest wrong impl: return the virtual `.vue.ts` path or virtual positions — pin exact file, line, col in the assertion.*

- [ ] **AC2** — Single-file, Vue with no errors: Given `file` pointing to a `.vue` file with no type errors, `getTypeErrors` returns `{ diagnostics: [], errorCount: 0, truncated: false }`.
  - *Layer: integration. Laziest wrong impl: always return the TS project's errors regardless of file — use a clean Vue fixture.*

- [ ] **AC3** — Project-wide in a Vue project: Given no `file` argument in a project that has type errors in both `.ts` files and `.vue` files, `getTypeErrors` returns errors from both. `.vue` errors have `file` pointing to the real `.vue` path (not virtual). The 100-error cap and `truncated` flag apply across the combined set.
  - *Layer: integration. Laziest wrong impl: skip `.vue` files entirely (current behavior) — assert that a `.vue` error appears in results.*

- [ ] **AC4** — `.ts` file in Vue project (regression guard): Given `file` pointing to a `.ts` file in a Vue project (routed through `VolarEngine`), `getTypeErrors` returns the same type errors as it would in a pure TS project with the same file.
  - *Layer: integration. One smoke test; covers the delegation path in `VolarEngine`.*

## Interface

No new parameters or response fields. The existing `GetTypeErrorsResult` shape is unchanged:

```typescript
interface GetTypeErrorsResult {
  diagnostics: TypeDiagnostic[];
  errorCount: number;   // true total, may exceed diagnostics.length when truncated
  truncated: boolean;   // true when capped at MAX_DIAGNOSTICS (100)
}

interface TypeDiagnostic {
  file: string;    // absolute path to the real .vue file (never the virtual .vue.ts path)
  line: number;    // 1-based line in the real .vue source
  col: number;     // 1-based column in the real .vue source
  code: number;    // TS diagnostic code (e.g. 2322)
  message: string; // top-level message text only (no chain)
}
```

`getTypeErrors` continues to accept an optional `file` (absolute path, `.ts` or `.vue`) and no-arg project-wide mode. No schema changes needed.

**Adversarial cases:**
- `.vue` file with only a `<template>` block (no `<script>`) — Volar generates no TypeScript service script; `getServiceScript` returns null; result is empty diagnostics (graceful, not an error).
- Volar glue code positions (no source map entry) — excluded from results, consistent with `translateSingleLocation` returning null.
- More than 100 errors across the combined TS + Vue set — truncated at 100; `errorCount` reflects the true total.

## Open decisions

All decisions resolved during spec:

**Engine interface extension:** Add `getTypeErrors(file: string | undefined, scope: WorkspaceScope): Promise<GetTypeErrorsResult>` to the `Engine` interface. `TsMorphEngine` delegates to existing `getForFile`/`getForProject` helpers. `VolarEngine` handles `.vue` files via Volar's `baseService.getSemanticDiagnostics(virtualPath)` and delegates `.ts` files to `this.tsEngine`. Dispatcher changes from `registry.tsEngine()` to `registry.projectEngine()`. This follows the identical pattern used by `extractFunction`.

**Position translation:** Virtual offset → real `.vue` offset via `mapper.toSourceLocation()` (same source-map machinery as `translateSingleLocation`). Real `.vue` offset → 1-based line/col via `offsetToLineCol()` from `text-utils.ts`. No need to construct a full TS `SourceFile` from the real content.

**Project-wide Vue file enumeration:** `VolarEngine.getTypeErrors(undefined, scope)` calls `this.tsEngine.getTypeErrors(undefined, scope)` to get TS errors, then builds/reuses a Volar service for the workspace root, iterates `service.vueVirtualToReal.keys()` to enumerate virtual `.vue.ts` paths, calls `baseService.getSemanticDiagnostics(virtualPath)` per file, translates positions, and merges. The 100-cap applies to the combined total.

**Template vs script-only:** Include all type errors from the virtual `.vue.ts` (matching `vue-tsc` and IDE behavior). Filtering to script-block-only would produce false negatives when a template references a renamed variable. The added complexity of SFC block-range filtering is not justified.

## Security

- **Workspace boundary:** `file` (when provided) is validated against the workspace in the operation layer before the engine is called — unchanged from current behavior. Project-wide mode iterates files registered in the Volar service for the workspace tsconfig; no files outside the project graph are checked.
- **Sensitive file exposure:** Diagnostics are read-only; no file content is written or returned. Same as existing TS behavior.
- **Input injection:** No new string parameters. `file` path already validated.
- **Response leakage:** Diagnostic messages come from the TypeScript compiler, same as existing behavior.

## Edges

- `.vue` files with no `<script>` block (template-only) return empty diagnostics — no error.
- Warnings and suggestions are excluded; only `DiagnosticCategory.Error`. Same policy as TS path.
- `errorCount` is the true total across both TS and `.vue` files combined.
- The dispatcher creates `makeRegistry(workspace, workspace)` for `getTypeErrors` (pathParams is empty). `projectEngine()` calls `findTsConfigForFile(workspace)` — this correctly detects Vue projects since the workspace root contains the tsconfig.
- Post-write type checking (`getTypeErrorsForFiles`) is out of scope; it still skips `.vue` files. A separate `[needs design]` entry covers that.

## Outcome

### Reflection

**What went well:** The implementation agent produced clean, well-structured code in a single commit covering all 4 ACs. The standalone-action extraction pattern (`src/plugins/vue/get-type-errors.ts`, `src/ts-engine/get-type-errors.ts`) kept both `VolarEngine` (407 lines) and the operation file (26 lines) well under threshold. The unit tests for the pure `translateVirtualOffset` helper were a nice addition, correctly placed at the unit layer.

**What didn't go well:** The agent created an unexpected test file (`src/plugins/vue/get-type-errors.test.ts`) alongside the integration tests in `getTypeErrors.test.ts`. This wasn't wrong — the spec's layer-fit note explicitly supports unit-testing extracted pure helpers — but the spec didn't anticipate it explicitly. The formatter failed on that new file (different formatting style), requiring a follow-up fix commit. A formatting check should be part of any pre-commit habit.

**`getTypeErrors.test.ts` grew to 394 lines** (from 227). The estimate of ~310 was off — the Vue tests added 167 lines, not ~80. The three separate tests for "real .vue path", "1-based line/col", and "pins exact position" cover AC1 from different angles; they could likely be merged into one combined "pins exact diagnostic shape" test, mirroring the existing TS pattern. Not blocking at 394 (under 500), but worth revisiting before the file grows further.

**What would I recommend to the next agent:** If touching `getTypeErrors.test.ts`, assess the three near-duplicate AC1 Vue tests first and consider consolidating. The `_probe.ts` synthetic path trick in `vueGetTypeErrorsForProject` (to anchor `findTsConfigForFile` at the workspace root) is non-obvious — it's documented in the implementation but warrants a note in `docs/tech/volar-v3.md`.
